# first-testnet-deploy

## Overview:

VERY simple Solidity smart contract that I created in order to learn how to manually deploy and interact with contracts using web3.py

## Deployment:

Contract was deployed on the Kovan test network. </br>
Contract Address: 0x15EA2F65225267906465c30D9FA84e8ADD7dF2C9

## Goal of Project

Main goal was to understand what is happening when compiling a contract, building a transaction, signing a transaction, and finally interacting with
said contract. </br>
Really just a precursor to using development and testing frameworks. </br>
